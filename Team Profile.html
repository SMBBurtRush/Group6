    <td>Hi, my name is Anna, and I am 20 years old. Since graduating high school I have been working in a customer facing role at a bank. I enjoy cooking in my spare time and trying foods from other cuisines. I am also an aquarium hobbyist and love to keep fish. As a side hustle, I make a little bit of pocket change by selling guppies and cherry shrimp. Two TV shows that I am currently watching are ‘The Boys’ and ‘Better Call Saul’. I became interested in IT as a potential career path as it is such a broad field and there are many areas that I could foray into. I do not have that much practical knowledge in IT. However, my father works in the IT sector, and I can see that he really enjoys his job. He encouraged me to try out some IT courses to see if it would suit me as well. I chose RMIT as this course was flexible enough to allow me to work during the weekdays. I am also looking at possibly enrolling in the Bachelor of IT once I finish the foundation subjects. Through this course I hope to gain a better understanding of what IT involves and the potential pathways into a career. I also hope to pick up some practical skills such as coding along the way. </td>

    <th>Shannon</th>
    <td>I was born in Australia with both English and Scandinavian heritage. Like most Australians, I’m unfortunately monolingual, although my daughter and I are currently learning some Mandarin. I can also read enough Italian to cook Italian-language recipes (I’m highly motivated by pasta!). My previous degrees include a Bachelor of Arts with a major in Archaeology and Classics; a Master of Teaching; and a Bachelor of Food Science and Nutrition. It will perhaps not surprise you to hear that I work as an administration officer and put most of my energy into my hobbies. I live in a flat overlooking a duck pond with my daughter and a particularly angry Chihuahua. </td>
