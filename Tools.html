				 <h2>GitHub Information: </h2>
				 <p>To make our group website we used the applications
					 Atom and GitHub Desktop to create, edit, and add all the
					 aspects of our project to the GitHub repository created by team
					 member Shannon with all other team members as collaborators.
					 Each team member added in their own research tasks and other parts
					 were split amongst the members of our group.<br><br>

					<h3>Graph of overall contributions to repository: </h3>
					<p><img src="contributions all.png" alt="Graph of Team Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter">
						This graph reflects very well our team's overall effort from the
						very beginning to the very end of our time working on the assignment.
						It shows that at the beginning there was not as much going into the
						repository as we were still working on the content. However, you can
						still see that the team was working on the basic framework for the
						website right from the beginning; particularly Shannon and Matthew
						(Quinn). The graph also reflects our unfortunate struggle to get
						everything uploaded and perfected towards the end of the timeline.</p>

							 Anna’s graph clearly reflects her struggles to get her work
							 finalised and uploaded onto the website until the very end of the
							 timeline. Unfortunately, Anna was unable to get her work finished
							 until very late in the assignment period despite being offered
							 help on multiple occasions. </p></td>

								 Jordan’s graph reflects that most of his work was contributions
								 to the report document rather than the GitHub repository. His
								 contribution to the website was the page for the research task
								 that he took on.</p></td>

								 <img src="contributions Shannon.png" alt="Graph of Shannon's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter"></strong>
								 Unfortunately, Shannon’s graph is somewhat deceiving as it seems
								 to portray them only putting in work at the very beginning of
								 the timeline and then not putting in half that same effort
								 towards the middle and end. Shannon put consistent work into
								 the assignment from the very beginning to the very end, with
								 focus on both the report document as well as the GitHub
								 repository. At the beginning they built most of the initial
								 framework for the website and added and edited work on the
								 website and the report document throughout the middle and end
								 of the timeline.

	 						 <td style="vertical-align: top"><strong><p>Matthew:
								 <img src="contributions Matthew.png" alt="Graph of Matthew's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter"></strong>
								 Matthew’s graph reflects very clearly that their contributions
								 started from the very beginning of the timeline, specifically
								 in building the initial framework for the website. In the
								 middle of the timeline, you can see that Matthew got their work
								 uploaded and formatted onto the website with some light edits
								 and fixes towards the end of the timeline.
