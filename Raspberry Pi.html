        <h2>What is Raspberry Pi?</h2>
        <p>RPF (2022) explains that Raspberry Pi is a low cost, small single-board computers that can plug into a computer monitor or TV and uses a keyboard and mouse. It is a proficient device which allows people of all ages to explore computing and learn how to program in different languages like C++ and Python. It has the same capabilities as a normal computer does, from browsing the internet and streaming content online, to running applications, word-processing. </p>
        <p>RPF (2022) also explains that ‘the Raspberry Pi can interact with the outside world and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work’. </p>
        <h2>What can be done now?</h2>
        <p>A Raspberry Pi has an incredible range of uses. It can be used for personal things such as running dedicated game servers, as a computer (runs Linux, Windows 10, FreeBSD, plan 9. WIKI (2022), to control a robot and making a retro gaming station (retro pi, retro arch) MUO (2019)</p>
        <p>RP (2019) Raspberry Pi can also be used for industrial projects like monitoring plants. This could include watering them autonomously and even sending alerts to staff when an emergency occurs such as wild animals trying to eat the plant, or the plant has fallen and needs to be put back onto the monitored area.</p>  
        <p>OS (2021) It also has applications in cryptocurrency. An AI running on the Raspberry Pi can be programmed to put money into different coins with an algorithm that follows trends, so it knows when to put money in and pull money out right before the targeted crypto coin is about to fall below a pre-set amount. For an example, a Raspberry Pi with this AI could be allocated $10 to put into crypto and the following options: it can put all the $10 into one cryptocurrency, it can put in a few cents or a few dollars into multiple different cryptocurrencies (to maximise profit and lessen the risk) or it could hold onto that money and wait for the crypto market to crash and buy the coins inexpensively before waiting for the market to rise back to a certain point to sell it.</p>
        <p>The current applications of Raspberry Pi are only limited by the imagination of the user. </p>
        <h2>What is it likely to be able to do in the next 3 years?</h2>
        <p>WIKI (2022) The ‘Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB RAM) came out May 2020’ and people are still finding novel uses for it now. So in three years' time it could run massive online games like World of Warcraft, or it could be used in even bigger projects like monitoring aquatic life in aquariums, running major blockchains, monitoring farm animals, operating security cameras, or being used in hospitals as a better way to monitor vital signs.</p>
        <h2>What technological or other developments make this possible? </h2>
        <p>What other technologies make what the raspberry pi could do in three years' time possible now is servers, routers, pre-built PCs (laptops), custom built PCs (laptops (did not know they were a thing)), pre-built software, vital signs monitor, ‘face recognition software (best being the amazon Rekognition)’ SP (2021). There are many more that can do what the raspberry pi can do in 3 years’ time, but the hardware is cumbersome. </p>
        <h1>What is the likely impact?</h1>
        <h2>What is the potential impact of this development?</h2>
        <p>As the price-point and size of the Raspberry Pi remain relatively small, and its ease of use straightforward, there may be increasing interest from the commercial sector. Companies outside the IT industry might start using Raspberry Pi, like makeup artists having a Raspberry Pi in their kit and using it to create 3D (3 Dimensional) renderings of what complex makeup might look like, or the food service industry using a Raspberry Pi for agile inventory and ordering. This would require IT professionals working in industries that they may not have previously.</p>
        <h2>What is likely to change?</h2>
        <p>The biggest aspect of Raspberry Pi to change would likely be how many people use it. It is becoming something that people experiment with, even those not part of the IT industry. It is a good educational tool that people of all ages can use and learn how to code, what hardware is included in a computer, and how hardware and software interact. It is likely that more hardware will become compatible with Raspberry Pi as more people begin to use it ROO (2022).</p>
        <h2>Which people will be most affected and how?</h2> 
        <p>The people most affected would be those who are new to IT and are trying to learn how to use hardware and code together. The Raspberry Pi is a good place to start when it comes to coding and hardware. There are many tutorials online that explore its broad functionality, and with the amount of hardware compatible with it (motors, sensors, gyroscopes etc.) it is possible to build some amazing things.</p>
        <h2>Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h2> 
        <p>If companies start using Raspberry Pi more, it will increase demand for IT in other industries. There may also be upheaval in established technologies in these other industries.  For example, Raspberry Pi being used in retail transactions would disrupt the existing Point of Sale technology.</p>
