       <section>
       	<h1>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h1>
       	<p>Developer Relations covers a wide gambit of stakeholder interactions. Within the company I will liaise with almost every department,
       		<ul>
       		<li>Product managers and developers, testing new features and giving guidance on product roadmaps.</li>
       		<li>Marketing, advising on tone and audience resonance along with helping create geeky fun and engaging content.</li>
       		<li>Sales, introductions to developers, tech folks and people that need help with plan upgrades.</li>
       		<li>Whole company, submitting talks to conferences and blog/livestream related content creation with product mentions. Additionally building out demos and relevant fun code related projects.</li>
       		<li>General public, sharing knowledge via a variety of mediums.</li>
       		<li>Developer communities, tracking ways to resonate content, understanding latest industry shift along with knowledge sharing and representing company/brand the best way possible.</li>
       		</ul>
       	</p>
       </section>
       <section>
       	<h1>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h1>
       	<p>Working 100% remotely Steven spends a lot of time interacting with various industry community groups on Twitter, Twitch, YouTube, slack, discord, LinkedIn, VR (Virtual Reality) worlds/platforms and other social platforms.</p>
       </section>
       <section>
       	<h1>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h1>
       	<p>Developer Relations is a multi-hat role and often changes faster than that of most of the tech industry. The most challenging part of the role is juggling all the different aspects to handle day to day plus generating relevant content utilising current best industry practice.</p>
       </section>
       <section>
       	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
       	<p>The part that most surprised me was the fact that developer Relations has so many distinct roles they need to do, and how fast the job can change. Having to work with so many different departments would be a challenge with time management and social skills, I don’t think I could ever do that job. Steven mostly works with people in Israel while living in Australia and has a global reach, so the difference in time zones would also be hard. Steven is a hard-working developer with a long and grand career in the industry, working with a lot of various parts from developer to public speaking at conventions, conferences, and meetups. As for what's in the future for Steven we will just have to wait and see.</p>
