       <h1>IT Work</h1>
       <section>
      <p>The IT professional I have interviewed is Steven Coochin (aka DeveloperSteve), who has worked for many different companies and in a variety of roles. Steven worked as a developer, developer advocate/evangelist and chief technology officer (CTO). Steven did his 100th talk in 2016 at Xero in New Zealand.</p> 
      <p>Some of the more notable highlights of Steven’s career include meeting a variety of coding language, platform and start-up/company founders and creators like Yukihiro Matsumoto (Chief Architect of Ruby), Hex and Banjo (from Good Game Spawn point), John Donahoe (previous president of Ebay and CEO of Nike), Massimo Banzi (founder of Arduino), working with the United Nations on a global hackathon series; and livestreaming for 9 hours straight with industry guests. DevStev (2022) Steven has worked for brands including Snyk, PayPal, Xero, BrainTree, IBM, Telstra, and Nginx.</p>
      <p>Craft (2022) Currently he is working for Lumigo, a serverless intelligence platform which helps developers understand and monitor serverless architecture. The company uses an AI-based engine to show operations inside the application to help start-ups build pure serverless applications and to enable large companies to start migrating existing applications to serverless. Lumigo has around 62 employees and two offices in San Fransico and Tel Aviv-Yafo.</p>
      <h2>What kind of work is done by the IT (Information Technology) professional?</h2>
      <p>Steven currently works in Developer Relations and has come from a strong background in application development and delivery. The developer relations role is based around being a company presence amongst industry communities. His role is to help promote industry best practice and adoption as a thought leader representing Lumigo’s brand. Developer relations is so broad, basically steven is a funded start-up inside the company so do everything that he needs to do.</p>

      <h2>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h2>
      <p>Developer Relations covers a wide gambit of stakeholder interactions. Within the company Steven works with almost every department. He also interacts with a number of external stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Interactions in an average workday may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Product managers and developers: Testing new features and giving guidance on product roadmaps.</li>
        <li>Marketing: Advising on tone and audience resonance along with helping create geeky fun and engaging content.</li>
        <li>Sales: Introductions to developers, tech folks and people that need help with plan upgrades.</li>
        <li>Industry professionals: Submitting talks to conferences and blog/livestream related content creation with product mentions. Additionally building out demos and relevant fun code-related projects.</li>
        <li>General public: Sharing knowledge via a variety of mediums (Livestreams on YouTube/twitch/twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook/Discord/Slack/GitHub, twitter, reddit, blogs, zoom, virtual event platforms, stack overflow, Virtual reality platforms like AltSpace.</li>
        <li>Developer communities: Tracking ways to resonate content, understanding latest industry shift along with knowledge-sharing and representing the company/brand in the best way possible.</li>
      </ul> 
      <h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2>
      <p>Working 100% remotely Steven spends a lot of time interacting with various industry community groups on Twitter, Twitch, YouTube, Slack, Discord, LinkedIn, VR (Virtual Reality) worlds/platforms and other social platforms. More specifically A combination of livestreaming/video production, technical writing, blog writing, events for starters.</p>
      <h2>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2> 
      <p>Developer Relations is a multi-hat role and often changes faster than that of most of the tech industry. Juggling all the activities, developer relations is a many hats role and sometimes it gets tricky knowing when to swap to what hat. on top of everything steven does is also being aware of new and emerging trends to talk about or use as part of content to engage the developer audience. He's not really marketing, development, or sales.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion </h2>
      <p>Learning about Steven’s average day in the office the part that most surprised me most was the fact that Developer Relations has so many distinct roles they need to do, and how fast the job can change. Having to work with so many different departments would be a challenge with time management and social skills – I don’t think I could ever do that job! Steven mostly works with people in Israel while living in Australia in a company with a global reach, so the difference in time zones would also be hard. Steven's wide-ranging career in the IT industry so far really shows the diversity and breadth of Information Technology. As for what's in the future for DeveloperSteve – we will just have to wait and see!</p>
