What does it do?

Cloud computing in simplest terms  refers to a collection of networks.  It is a model that gives the ability to remotely access a shared range of computing resources such as networks servers, storage, applications and services. The benefit of cloud computing is that the user does not have to set up their own infrastructure but instead utilize a mediator to provide for the service of the internet in cloud computing. Many businesses and organizations  increasingly use cloud computing in their daily operations as it can be more efficient and help to create smoother workflows. Cloud computing has also seen a greater demand with the current work context since the start of the pandemic.

What can be done now?

Software as a Service (SaaS)
Saas  encompasses a variety of services, such as file storage and backup, web-based email, and project management tools.Examples of SaaS cloud service providers include Dropbox, G Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Slack and Citrix Content Collaboration. In each of these applications, users can access, share, store, and secure information in “the cloud.”
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a service, or IaaS, provides the infrastructure that many cloud service providers need to manage SaaS tools—but don’t want to maintain themselves. It serves as the complete data center, eliminating the need for resource-intensive, on-site installations. Examples of IaaS are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Compute Engine. These providers maintain all storage servers and networking hardware, and may also offer load balancing, application firewalls, and more

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS is a web-based environment where developers can build cloud apps. PaaS provides a database, operating system and programming language that organizations can use to develop cloud-based software, without having to maintain the underlying elements. Developers can access their projects remotely from a web browser because the development project is not hosted locally. This tool allows for global collaboration and increases efficiency.


What is likely to be done soon?

It is expected that more businesses will turn to adopting cloud computing given the enormous amount of resources it provides and the lower cost compared to maintaining their own data centers.  A study by Gartner predicts that by 2025, 75% of internet data will be processed outside of traditional data centers, occurring between local internet enabled devices and servers within their proximity (IBM 2018).


What is the likely impact?



These services are changing over time, and some experts are suggesting that the current state of technology is likely representative of the medium term, with one change visible on the horizon (Heath 2021). This change is the emergence of edge computing, the advent of which would add another layer to the current internet landscape and device interactions with the cloud. Predictions by Gartner are that by 2025, 75% of internet data will be processed outside of traditional data centers, occurring between local internet enabled devices and servers within their proximity (IBM 2018). As an upcoming trend this poses challenges, challenges shared by current services.
One challenge is in infrastructure hurdles, such as the requirements for fast networks and well distributed server locations. Currently network traffic requirements are met using centralised servers, where frequently accessed content is cached in various locations to enable quick delivery (Ellingwood 2014). These challenges are likely to be ever present as the volume and type of data traffic increases to meet the rising requirements for new services and cloud connected devices. Additional infrastructure and advances in technology are required to mitigate the bottlenecks in our current networks.





How will this affect you?

 With the increasing rate of technological adoption, it is foreseeable that every human being will someday be able to access the cloud. Now, however, there are currently just under 60% of individuals world-wide connected to the internet. This means that billions of new people and devices will someday be connected to the cloud, creating additional demand for innovative technology. The pace of our lives will increase as many of the trivial daily tasks become more automated. Smart devices will increasingly do more, such as simple math, offer directions, and tell us when we need to seek medical treatment without needing to be asked.

Personal privacy may be further compromised in the future than what it is today (Chamorro-Premuzic & Nahai 2017; Kessler 2018). When all our actions are done through the cloud, our whole lives could come to depend on it, meaning we would also be susceptible when things go wrong, such as through cyber security incidents. Cyber security incidents will likely increase. In Australia last year there was a cybercrime reported every 10 minutes (Skatssoon 2020)/ Hackings, data leaks and fraud have become increasingly commonplace. These incidents affect everyone, to just the average user to IT security specialist. The constantly changing landscape requires continual vigilance on the part of every user.

What would be different?

As the world becomes more connected by the cloud with potentially all our interactions going through it, everyone worldwide will be affected by both improvements in technology and the flow-on effects of any disruptions. One of these is the automation that the cloud allows, affecting the requirement for staff to perform the same duties. There are likely to be many new jobs in cloud services created and many in traditional IT lost, such as the change in nature of the roles created to manage in-house technology which have evolved into higher-level coordination between the different cloud services that businesses now require online (Stame 2020; Collabera n.d.).

From work to family to gaming with friends, everything will become more interconnected. Although originally intended as a network designed for emergency government and military communication, the Internet has grown into a multifaceted “Cloud” network serving billions of people worldwide. The public reliance on the services of the cloud have evolved over time, yet many technologies have remained as consistent staples for the masses, such as the need for social media platforms for example. While it is difficult to see too far into the technological future, it seems likely that the current internet landscape will continue, with gradual improvements building on the legacy of current systems ensuring that the Cloud and its services are here to stay.
